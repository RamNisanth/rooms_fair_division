# rooms_fair_division
this is a Python code for fairly dividing the rooms among housekeepers.

This code solves the problem of fairly dividing the rooms among the housekeepers.

what do I mean by fair division?

Back story: My uncle works in a motel in the US. they used to keep track of the rooms using an Excel sheet. Though they have software to track all the rooms the software cannot give him the big picture of where the rooms are free. while making the maids list they use the Excel sheet (rooms availability sheet) 

fair division: assume that on a particular day, the number of maids = 2,  and the rooms were booked like this  
{101, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108, 201, 203, 204, 301, 304 }
now if we need to divide the rooms then we divide the rooms like this = [101, 103, 105, 106, 107, 108,]; [201, 203, 204, 301, 304]
because maid 2 works in more than one level and that's extra work for the maid. 

there are 2 cases number of maids =2 and 3.
